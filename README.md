# Mobile Manipulator

![Mobile Manipulator](path/to/your/image.png)

A Python-based implementation for controlling and simulating a mobile manipulator. This project is designed to provide modular tools for robotic researchers and developers working on mobile manipulation tasks such as pick-and-place operations, navigation, and control.

## Features
- Modular design for easy extension.
- Integration with popular robotic frameworks (e.g., ROS).
- Simulation-ready and hardware-compatible.
- Example algorithms for navigation and manipulation.
- Customizable robot models and task parameters.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.8+
- ROS (if using with robotic systems)
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pyimagedata/mobile_manipulator.git
   cd mobile_manipulator
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up ROS environment (optional):
   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/<ros-distro>/setup.bash
   ```

## Usage

### Simulation

To run the simulation:

```bash
python simulation.py
```

### Hardware Integration

For real-world applications, integrate the code with your robotic hardware by:

1. Configuring the hardware parameters in `config/hardware.yaml`.
2. Running the hardware interface script:
   ```bash
   python hardware_control.py
   ```

### Custom Tasks

To create custom tasks:

1. Define the task logic in a new script under `tasks/`.
2. Import the task in `main.py` and execute it.
